    <h2>IPL 2019: CSK look to be back on top against Delhi Capitals </h2>

<p>Their net run-rate slipping into negative after a defeat against Mumbai Indians, defending champions Chennai Super Kings will be keen to get back to No. 1 spot when they take on current table-toppers Delhi Capitals in an IPL match here on Wednesday.
An interesting contest is on the cards between two current top teams and a win for either side will help it consolidate its position and ultimately could have a bearing on where it finishes in the final standings.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni-less CSK went down rather tamely to Mumbai Indians in their last game, which saw their net run-rate falling. Now with just two games left in the league stage, CSK will look to roar back with victories to seal a spot in the top two and get the home comfort in Qualifier 1. 
Without his inspiring presence, CSK’s batting collapsed against MI and they lost the game by 46 runs to surrender their position at the top of the points table to Delhi.

With 16 points from 12 games, CSK will be hoping that their talismanic captain recovers from the bout of fever, which forced him to sit out the MI fixture, and be ready to feature in the last home match of the league phase.
Also, the home team will be expecting influential all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja to be back in the mix too.
Delhi Capitals, on the other hand, would be high on confidence having posted four wins in their last five matches. 
Young Shreyas Iyer has done a good job of leading the team, which also has 16 points from 12 games, and has scored important runs.</p>
        
        
<h3>David de Gea: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer must drop Man Utd keeper - Ian Wright</h3>

<p>Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer must drop goalkeeper David de Gea following his recent mistakes, says ex-Premier League striker Ian Wright.
The Spaniard spilled Antonio Rudiger's 30-yard shot on Sunday, allowing Marcos Alonso to earn a point for Chelsea as United's top-four hopes faded.
De Gea has made three errors leading to a goal in his past four games.
"There's something that's not right," Wright said on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club.
"If he [Solskjaer] really wants to stamp his mark and let people know he isn't afraid to make decisions, he should take him out.
"If the manager explains everything and tells him face to face why he's leaving him out and giving him a break, that's man-management - and that's what Solskjaer has to do."
'De Gea has become an unexpected dilemma for Solskjaer'
Who will win the race for the top four? Shearer analysis
Mistakes against Manchester City and Barcelona mean De Gea has, in the space of 13 days, matched the total number of costly errors he made in 123 previous club appearances.
However, his manager insists he still "trusts" the 28-year-old, whose Old Trafford contract expires in just over a year.
United have two Premier League games remaining this season, travelling to face already-relegated Huddersfield on Sunday before hosting Cardiff on the final day.
In light of recent performances, former Arsenal and England forward Wright sees those fixtures as an opportunity for Solskjaer to field reserve keeper Sergio Romero, allowing De Gea, the subject of persistent transfer speculation, an early summer break.
"He needs to go on holiday and sort his contract out," said Wright. "Sometimes you have to take someone out the firing line. 
"He's one of the best goalkeepers in the world and he just needs a break. There's a lot going on and he's under a lot of pressure. When you look at how United are playing at the moment, putting him in that situation is putting him under more pressure.</p>
   
    <h4>Vijay Shankar’s bowling will be handy in English conditions: Sourav Ganguly</h4>
    
    <img src="images/img7.jpg" height="300" width="600" />
    
        <p>Former India captain Sourav Ganguly Tuesday backed Tamil Nadu all-rounder Vijay Shankar to do well in the upcoming World Cup, saying his bowling would come in handy in the English conditions. There has been debate over Shankar being picked in the England-bound India team ahead of Ambati Rayudu, with the selectors saying they went for the “three-dimensional skills” offered by the Tamil Nadu player.

“Vijay Shankar will do well. He is a good young cricketer. His bowling will come handy. Let’s not be too negative about him. He has got a place because he has played in Australia and New Zealand and done well,” Ganguly, who is advisor to IPL team Delhi Capitals told PTI in an interaction.
The former skipper also said that talented Rishabh Pant, who has been ignored for this edition, should not feel depressed about his non-selection. “Yes, Pant also could have been part of this side but he need not worry. He has many more years. He is just 20, he will play a few World Cups.”
Asked if India could go all the way with three front-line pacemen, Ganguly said that’s the way the team wants to play with an all-rounder at number 7.

“Pandya is the first choice. If he gets injured, then (Ravindra) Jadeja. That allows them to play three fast bowlers. If anybody gets injured it is just a 10-hour flight,” he added.
On the 50-overs World Cup, Ganguly said this edition could be very competitive due the format, where all teams play each other in the league stage. “This format was last tried in 1992 when everyone played everyone. In the past we felt there were one or two weak ones. This time it is not so. West Indies is strong, Australia is back to where they were, New Zealand is strong, India is strong. And Pakistan played very well in England,” he added.</p>
        
        <h5>Tennis round-up: Nadal overcomes Struff to make Barcelona semis</h5>
    
    <img src="images/img8.jpg"height="300" width="600" />
    
        <p>The world number two will meet Dominic Thiem in the last four, a re-match of last year's French Open final, after the Austrian overpowered Argentine Guido Pella 7-5, 6-2.
Struff, ranked 51st in the world and a renowned doubles player, had impressed in Barcelona by knocking out 10th seed David Goffin and last year's runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas and was facing Nadal for the first time in a competitive match.
The Mallorcan broke to take a 3-1 lead with a powerful forehand winner down the line but Struff broke back to make it 4-4.
Nadal broke his opponent for a second time to avoid a tiebreak and take the set.
Neither player gave much away in a finely balanced second set, and Struff saved a break point in the eighth game to keep things finely balanced, but Nadal was saving his best tennis for the 12th game.

Nadal quickly earned three match points and seized the second with a magnificent backhand down the line to end the match in one hour and 43 minutes.
"Me and my coaches knew he (Struff) was going to play aggressively, it was one of those matches where every point counts, he put me under a lot of pressure so I had to play through that but my serve was solid throughout," Nadal said.
"I'm aware that I was facing someone who has beaten Tsitsipas and Goffin this week so I'm very happy that I was able to win."
Nadal won a five-set thriller against Thiem in their last meeting, in the quarter-finals of the 2018 US Open, having beaten him in straight sets in the final at Roland Garros.
Thiem won his last meeting with Nadal on Spanish soil, however, knocking the Spaniard out of last year's Madrid Open in the quarter-finals in straight sets.
Japan's Kei Nishikori also made it into the last four after seeing off Roberto Carballes Baena 6-4, 7-5 and will face Russian Daniil Medvedev, who knocked out Chilean Nicolas Jarry 6-3, 6-4.</p>

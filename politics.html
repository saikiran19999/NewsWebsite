                <p>Actor-turned-politician Rajinikanth, ending months of speculation and suspense, on Sunday declared that he would not contest the upcoming general elections or support anyone. In a statement, he said, "I'm not going to contest in Lok Sabha elections. Our target is assembly elections. My support is not for any party. Hence no party should use my photo or my outfit's logo in campaign."He also asked people to examine and vote for a party that would form a strong government and implement schemes to solve Tamil Nadu's water crisis permanently. The 765-km long Cauvery river, also called the "Ganga of the south", is the lifeline for Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The distribution of water between the southern neighbours has been a contentious issue for decades.

<h3>Priyanka Gandhi's Ability To Undercut PM Modi's Appeal: Foreign Media</h3>

<p>The freshest face in Indian politics looks a lot like one from the past. And it could haunt Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he mounts an increasingly fraught bid for re-election.
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, 47, who was formally appointed to a senior role in the Congress Party this week, has the curly hair, bearing and crowd-drawing appeal of her formidable grandmother. As prime minister, Indira Gandhi towered over Indian politics for decades and sent shivers into her opponents, some of whom she jailed -- including the two founders of PM Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party.
That's a far cry from the Indian political landscape of the last four-and-a-half years, when a dominant PM Modi and his BJP have mocked Congress leaders and ruled over parliament with the first single-party majority in 30 years, a mandate last won by the Congress in 1984 after Indira Gandhi was assassinated.
But with the appointment of Ms Gandhi to a post in Uttar Pradesh state, the Congress Party led by her brother Rahul is seeking to capitalize on new-found political momentum after it trounced the BJP in three state votes last month, a victory that has injected uncertainty into a general election to be held by May in which PM Modi was until recently the runaway favorite.</p>
   
    <h4>Indian Political Parties Almost Entirely Funded By Corporates, Shows Data</h4>
    
    <img src="images/img1.jpg" height="300" width="600" />
    
        <p>Donations above Rs.20,000 received by parties amounted to Rs.469.89 crore in 2017-18, of which a mammoth Rs.437.04 crore from 2,977 donors was donated to the BJP alone, according to a report by the Association for Democratic Reforms or ADR.
The Congress received Rs.26.658 crore from 777 donors, while the BJP's share is almost 17 times this amount.
In fact, the donation received by all national parties combined, except the BJP, comes to a paltry Rs.32.667 crore. 
"The donations declared by BJP is more than 12 times the aggregate declared by INC, NCP, CPI, CPM and AITC for the same period", said the report.
But more interestingly, almost all of this funding came from corporate donors. 90 per cent of the entire sum of donations, amounting to Rs 422.04 crore, comes from the business sector, according to Election Commission data analysed by ADR. </p>
        
        <h5>Farewell, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Iconic Leader Cremated With State Honours</h5>
    
    <img src="images/img3.jpg" height="300" width="600" />
    
        <p>Mr Vajpayee's foster daughter Namita Bhattacharya lit the funeral pyre as a 21-gun salute went off at the Smriti Sthal.
A sea of people had followed Mr Vajpayee's funeral procession from the headquarters of the ruling BJP, the party he helped form in 1980. Prime Minister Narendra Modi walked the entire four km stretch behind the flower-decked gun carriage, along with other top BJP leaders and ministers.
A massive crowd chanted "long live Atal-ji" and showered rose petals on the glass casket carrying the three-time prime minister, who died yesterday after a long illness.
"I am speechless, numb," PM Modi had said, expressing his grief. "It's like losing a father."</p>
